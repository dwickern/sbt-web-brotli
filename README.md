sbt-web-brotli
==========

[sbt-web] plugin for brotli-compressing web assets using [jvmbrotli] bindings.

Rewritten from [sbt-gzip] sources, thanks to Typesafe/Lightbend.
Some parts of code, docs, tests are copy-pasted with no changes.


Usage
----------

Add the plugin to `project/plugins.sbt`:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.github.dwickern" % "sbt-web-brotli" % "1.0.0")
```

Add `brotli` to the sbt-web asset pipeline in your `build.sbt`:

```scala
pipelineStages := Seq(brotli)
```

Pipeline stages are only used in the production build.
To see the output of your pipeline, run in your sbt shell:

```
> show webStage
```

Configuration
-------------

### Filters

Include and exclude filters can be provided. For example, to only create brotli files for `.js` files:

```scala
brotli / includeFilter := "*.js"
```

Or to exclude all `.js` files but include any other files:

```scala
brotli / excludeFilter := "*.js"
```

The default filters configured like this:

```scala
brotli / includeFilter := "*.html" || "*.css" || "*.js"
brotli / excludeFilter := HiddenFileFilter || "*.woff" || "*.woff2" || "*.gz"
```

### Usage with sbt-gzip

If you also use `sbt-gzip`, make sure `brotli` comes after `gzip` in the pipeline:

```scala
pipelineStages := Seq(gzip, brotli)
```

Or, alternatively, configure `gzip` to ignore the brotli-compressed files:

```scala
pipelineStages := Seq(brotli, gzip)
gzip / excludeFilter ~= { _ || "*.br" }
```
